*Please note: Because of the superfeedr pricing change and less available time I gave up on this project. Still think it's a nice example for this kind of software, but there are actively developed alternatives one should rather use. This repo will be archived.*

**feedtrag√≥n** is a small self-hosted RSS-reader. Instead of polling feeds on its own, it is using [superfeedr](https://superfeedr.com) to get updates of subscribed feeds.
